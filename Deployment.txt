Designed to be run as a container, presumably via Docker

The following terms apply to the subsequent descriptions and notes:
    {sysid} A system identifier consisting of 1 to 6 digits or uppercase letters

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A container shall be created which is comprised of JRE version 13 (as a minimum).
That container will be configured to run Komodo at container startup.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Source entities are located in the /resources project folder
/resources
    /config
        Initial configuration artifacts, copied into the production /config directory at deployment time
    /media
        /binaries
            any necessary loadable binaries such as diagnostics, dprep, etc
            copied to the /binaries directory at deployment
        /disks
            preformatted, preloaded disk pack(s) which are copied to the /disks directory at deployment
        /tapes
            prewritten tape volumes (including a boot tape) which are copied to the /tapes directory at deployment
    /web
        Contains the various web-related directories, including the system console and terminal javascript code
        Copied to the /web directory at deployment time


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

External volumes shall be mapped to the following directories.
This directory structure is to be implemented by an initialization deployment script.
These directories are subject to hard-coding in Komodo, although in practice such hard-coding is likely to be
    restricted to a common file of constant definitions.

/binaries
        Contains binary files each of which contains loadable mainframe code
        One file shall be the bootstrap code loaded into an emulated system by the SP
        Additional files comprise the body of offline diagnostic tools (such as a DPREP tool) invoked via the SP

/config
    System configuration is kept here
    /config/hardware.json
        Current hardware configuration of the system
        Defines the various virtual hardware nodes along with their particular attributes
    /config/software.json
        Current software configuration of the system
    /config/log4j2.xml
        System logging configuration

/disks
    Where all disk volumes are kept.
    These volumes are assigned on to each disk device
    System file names are formatted as {sysid}.disk
    {sysid} shall match the pack name as stored in the volume record
    Disk Device objects may be (probably will be) configured to mount one of these .dsk volumes at instantiation or startup

/logs
    System logs are written to this subdirectory

/symbionts
    Represent input and output directories for virtual card and print devices
    This directory consists of multiple subdirectories, one per symbiont device
    Each directory name is formatted as {sysid} where the name matches the name of the symbiont device
    card reader devices read files from their corresponding directory as they appear, and convert them to
        SDF files in the general swap file area, for eventual processing as batch jobs.
        The format of the filenames in this directory is arbitrary
        The data format is a simple text file
    card punch devices place their output into their corresponding directory as simple text files
    printer devices place their output into their corresponding directory

    Note - it is envisioned that certain types of symbionts will exist, which accept input and product output
        over secure network sockets; the protocols for doing so are as yet TBD, and do not affect deployment
        in any particular way, excepting if and as they require opened network ports

/tapes
    Where all tape volumes are kept.
    The files in this directory and its subdirectories represent individual (virtual) reels/volumes of tape
    System file names are formatted as {sysid}.tape
    {sysid} corresponds to the volume number of the tape
    A file having the read-only attribute corresponds to a reel which does not have a write-ring inserted
    Reels formatted as SYnnnn.tape are deployed at installation, contain released software, and can never be overwritten

/web
    This directory is the presumed base directory for all files which are read from the HTTP server(s)
    Thus, GET of /foo.js will retrieve /resources/web/foo.js
/web/library
    Contains third-party .js and .css files
/web/systemConsole
    Contains .js, .css, and .html files for the system console web application
    Implements all functionality necessary to configure and operate Komodo
    Contains favicon.ico as well
/web/terminal
    Contains .js, .css, and .html files for the attached terminal application
    This application implements a variation of a standard Uniscope(TM) terminal
    Contains favicon.ico as well
