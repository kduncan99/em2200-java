/**
 * Handles the LRS instruction f=072 j=017
 * This instruction loads one or two consecutive sets of values from a single buffer in memory to GRS locations.
 * The two sets are contiguous in memory; they do not have to be contiguous in the GRS.
 *
 * A(a) contains a descriptor formatted as such:
 *  Bit2-8:     count2
 *  Bit11-17:   address2
 *  Bit20-26:   count1
 *  Bit29-35:   address1
 *
 * Effective u refers to the buffer in memory.  GRS access does not apply.
 * Standard address resolution for consecutive memory addresses does apply.
 * The size of the buffer must be at least count1 + count2 words in length.
 *
 * The first set of transfers begins with the source set to effective U + 0, and the destination is the GRS register
 * at address 1.  {count1} words are transferred from consecutive locations in memory to consecutive GRS registers.
 * If at any point the GRS index reaches 0200, it is reset to 0, and the process continues.
 * The second set of transfers then begins with the source set to effective U + {count1} (or an appropriate value if
 * wraparound occurred at index 0200) and with the GRS register at address 2.  {count2} words are transferred just
 * as they were in the first set.
 *
 * If count1 or count2 are zero, the corresponding register transfer is effectively a NOP.
 *
 * A(a) may be included in the register transfer, so the content thereof will be pulled out and stored separately
 * in order to not be overwritten during the process.
