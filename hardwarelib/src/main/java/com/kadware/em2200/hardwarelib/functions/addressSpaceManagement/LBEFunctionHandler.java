The LBE instruction loads one of the executive Base_Registers B16–B31, specified by Ba+16, to
describe the Bank (and subset, if applicable) specified by (U), which is in the form of a
Virtual_Address (L,BDI,Offset).
The LBE instruction algorithm is described in the following steps.
1. A determination is made of the Base_Register information to be loaded into Ba+16 as
described in 4.6.4, steps 3 through 9.
Operation_Notes:
 When the Source L,BDI is 0,0, Ba+16 is set void (B.V := 1).
 When the Target L,BDI refers to either a Basic_Mode or Extended_Mode bank, the Target
BD is loaded.
 When the Target L,BDI refers to a Gate Bank, Gate processing does not occur. The Gate
Bank becomes the target BD and it is loaded.
2. Ba+16 is loaded, describing the Bank determined in step 1 above. Subsetting, if applicable,
occurs (see 4.6.6).
3. Unless Ba.V := 1, the Target BD.G is checked and, if Target BD.G = 1, the condition is reported
through a Terminal_Addressing_Exception interrupt. If the void resulted from the calculation
of a negative Upper_Limit while subsetting, it is Architecturally_Undefined whether these
checks are made. Note: Ba+16 remains loaded with the BD information.
See 4.6 for further clarification of addressing instructions, including a generic Base_Register
Manipulation algorithm (see 4.6.4) and a list of the restrictions placed on executive software on
the manipulation of addressing structures, allowing for model_dependent addressing instruction
acceleration schemes (see 4.6.5).
