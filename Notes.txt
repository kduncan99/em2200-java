Lose unnecessary accessors (in progress)
minalib unit tests for node references

-- BUGS
BUG: NOP isn't being handled correctly by mina...
BUG: JK, and possibly all conditional jumps - if calculated U is out of limits we get reference violation
  even if we don't take the jump - we shouldn't do this for not-jumping (I think, verify with express 2200)

-- TODO
baselib put TNGM in the table right after TLEM as an alias, so minalib can assemble it
minalib unit tests for string value generation
minalib support special form for JGD instruction
minalib support node references on LHS of $EQU statements
minalib need to put partial-words into the dictionary
minalib use UndefinedReferenceDiagnostic for urefs
minalib use DiagnosticDirective for stuff
pick up the rest of the unit tests we need to do but haven't yet
minalib do we need microstrings?
minalib support special form for BT instruction
minalib $USE (A.2.8) specifies base register to use if none given
minalib add test cases for interrupts (many of them already marked TODO)
minalib float values - firm this up (how do we support it)
minalib data generation - floats
minalib can we do implicit base register (and do it right)?  also with the $LIT directive...
minalib make sure we don't propagate flagged attribute in any of the operators
minalib support user-defined functions
minalib allow expression list inside literal which is part of expression
  e.g., ((005, 007) + 12)

minalib functions
  $ILCN
  $L0
  $L1
  $LCB
  $LCFV
  $LCN
  $SSS
  $LCV
  $NODE (an empty node - this is maybe a built-in value, not a function?)
minalib directives
  $END directive on top-level code (do we require it?)
  $EQUF
  $USE (implicit base register)
  $INSERT (maybe)
  $BASE (maybe)
  $IF / $ELSE / $ELSF / $ENDF
  $DO / $ENDD
  $REPEAT / $ENDR
  $FORM
  $GEN
  $INCLUDE (what does this mean for us?)
  $INFO finish the various groups we're going to implement

hardwareLib note - when changing code banks, observe q/t word mode, and arithfault modes
hardwarelib Finish adding instructions to IP
    CR from test categories
    Other categories
hardwarelib UPI send/ack mechanism
hardwarelib Figure out how to do channel programs
  do we need a cleaner IO path?
  we'd still like word and byte operations... don't we?
hardwarelib Rewrite disk (and maybe tape) devices using async IO
hardwarelib All Device objects: add Builder class, make constructors private
hardwarelib Device.IoInfo objects: add Builder class, make constructors private

Mina - wrapper around minalib

Exec - using Mina (or minalib, but hopefully mina)
