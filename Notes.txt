Logging - what is the difference between source and entity?

*sci.js and related
Console help for KEXEC console commands
IPL page
  System status(?)
  Dump button
  Maybe an indication of the number of sessions connected?
  Help describing the KEXEC usage of the jump keys
  Boot source (binary selection of tape boot, disk boot, other binary boot)
  Path and volume selection for tape and disk boots
Hardware page
  Node configuration, basically
System page
  All the non-hardware related configurables
    Give SCIF the ability to control logging levels
        The following, in Node.java, should be subject to management by SCIF / SoftwareConfiguration
            static final boolean LOG_CHANNEL_IOS = true;
            static final boolean LOG_CHANNEL_IO_BUFFERS = true;
            static final boolean LOG_DEVICE_IOS = true;
            static final boolean LOG_DEVICE_IO_BUFFERS = true;
            static final boolean LOG_IO_ERRORS = true;
OS Configuration page (new page)
  KEXEC configuration items

* hardwarelib
SP: Move dayclock architecture to SystemProcessor
IP: SYSC subfunctions need unit tests
CM: ChannelModules should log based on LOG_CHANNEL_IOS and LOG_CHANNEL_IO_BUFFERS (or the config equivalent)

*minalib
Support $EQUF - need to review all of Appendix A of MASM ref, then work on mnemonic generation
Do we emit diagnostics at the point where 'S' post-fix operator is applied to a value larger than 36 bits? Or only when we generate code?

-- TODO BUGS
* hardwarelib
ByteChannelModule unit tests - they wait without being notify()able, which slows down IO tests
Check to ensure breakpoints are all working.

* minalib
Assembler isn't returning null module when errors are detected... why?
    Do all T diagnostics result in a rel module not being generated?
((077) + 5) does not generate a literal 077 as it should do
String concatenation does not honor precision per MASM 5.3.1
assembler needs to be smart enough to do the right thing with B16-B31 (move msbit to .i field)


-- TODO Thoughts


-- TODO implement
* every all
Set logger name to foo.class.getSimpleName()

* baselib
more FloatingPointComponent tests

* hardwarelib
Redo all the node and subclasses tests, many of which are commented out (Node has been done)
For FSTDevice, what to do when we try to read with _writeFlag or _writeMarkFlag set?
Need some unit tests of proper DR settings across interrupts, returns, and UR instruction
RAMDiskDevice word interface, optional dedupe with SHA-256, required backing store
RAMTapeDevice byte interface, optional compression, optional backing store
PrinterDevice
CardReaderDevice
CardPunchDevice
IP: SYSC subfunctions for IO
IP: need more address space management instructions unit tests
IP: basic mode procedure call unit tests for LBJ, LIJ, LDJ for basic and extended mode banks
IP: extended mode procedure call unit tests for GOTO, CALL to basic mode
IP: unit tests
  LIJ, LBJ, LDJ
  LD, SD, LPD, SPD, LUD, SUD, LAE, UR, ACEL, DCEL, SKQT, KCHG
  LRD, SMD, RMD, LMC, SDMN, SDMS, SDMF, RDC
Change unit test extended mode dbanks to start at lower-limit 0 - this *should* work...
For basic mode, no need really to test the bank limits on every fetch - set it once, then save it and use it...
  what to do when we run off the end of the bank?
need some conditional jump tests which would incur reference violation if they jumped
    both jumping (ref violation) and not jumping (no ref violation)

* minalib
We really need to support identifiers > 12 characters
more FloatingPointValue unit tests
more unit tests for string value generation
unit tests for node references - need to check results
unit tests for more built-in functions - we're missing a lot of them
support special form for JGD instruction
support special form for BT instruction
support node references on LHS of $EQU statements
need to put partial-words into the dictionary - and should we allow these as expressions in j-field?
remove UndefinedReferenceDiagnostic (I think...)
use DiagnosticDirective for stuff.. now I forgot what this means
do we need microstrings?
$USE (A.2.8) specifies base register to use if none given
add test cases for interrupts (many of them already marked TODO)
can we do implicit base register (and do it right)?  also with the $LIT directive...
support user-defined functions
allow expression list inside literal which is part of expression e.g., ((005, 007) + 12)
functions
  $ILCN
  $L0
  $L1
  $LCB
  $LCFV
  $LCN
  $SSS
  $LCV
  $NODE (an empty node - this is maybe a built-in value, not a function?)
directives
  $END
  $USE (implicit base register)
  $INSERT (maybe)
  $BASE (maybe)
  $IF / $ELSE / $ELSF / $ENDF
  $DO / $ENDD
  $REPEAT / $ENDR
  $GEN
  $INCLUDE (what does this mean for us?)
  $INFO finish the various groups we're going to implement

* Mina - wrapper around minalib

* Exec - using Mina (or minalib, but hopefully mina)

  Init
  Console (can we farm this out to SCP?)
