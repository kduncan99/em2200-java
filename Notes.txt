InProgress
minalib $GFORM directive
Convert IP unit tests from octal to assembler and minalib them (in progress)
Lose unnecessary accessors (in progress)
unit tests - all tests expected to run to completion should ensure they actually did
        assertEquals(InstructionProcessor.StopReason.Debug, ip.getLatestStopReason());
        assertEquals(0, ip.getLatestStopDetail());

TODO
minalib support procs
minalib system JK proc to do the  "right thing" for the JK instruction (requires hard-fixing an A register)
minalib add test cases for interrupts (many of them already marked TODO)
minalib should we raise a diag on any $xxxx in op field which is not in the dictionary?
minalib special mnemonics need attention (JGD, BT, etc)
minalib data generation - strings
minalib float values - firm this up
minalib data generation - floats
minalib put directives into the system dictionary
minalib can we do implicit base register (and do it right)?  also with the $LIT directive...
minalib make sure we don't propagate flagged attribute in any of the operators
minalib support user-defined functions
minalib allow expression list inside literal which is part of expression
  e.g., ((005, 007) + 12)

hardwarelib Finish adding instructions to IP
hardwarelib UPI send/ack mechanism
hardwarelib Figure out how to do channel programs
  do we need a cleaner IO path?
  we'd still like word and byte operations... don't we?
hardwarelib Rewrite disk (and maybe tape) devices using async IO
hardwarelib All Device objects: add Builder class, make constructors private
hardwarelib Device.IoInfo objects: add Builder class, make constructors private

Mina - wrapper around minalib

Exec - using Mina (or minalib, but hopefully mina)
